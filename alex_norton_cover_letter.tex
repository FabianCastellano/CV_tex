\indent Hello my name is Alex Norton.   I am seeking an entry-level software developer
position with \companyName.   I graduate this May with a bachelor’s degree in
Computer Science and hands on experience with Ruby on Rails to create and
implement web applications.  Currently, I am finishing my last semester abroad
in Oxford, England. 

As an undergraduate teaching assistant for the past year and an Amazon SDE
intern this summer.  I have learned how to collaborate with a team and work
outside my knowledge set.

At my internship at Amazon, my responsibilities included version control,
semantic highlighting and executing runtime environments.  All of the above
helped me understand the collaboration process between peers that must be
done in order to carry out a finely polished product.  My biggest discovery
was that to be successful in any field hinges on your ability to work
diligently with your coworkers to constantly over achieve.

What attracted me to \companyName is the power of building friendships.  When
you use \companyName you are doing more than living in someones home, you are
entering their world.  You cross paths with a different culture, place, and
maybe emotions you have never seen before.  I just used \companyName for the
first time in Berlin and the experience has given me the impetus to travel the
world.  \companyName can not only change your location but it can change your
heart.

What made me apply to this position of Full Stack Engineer  is my love for ruby programming.  I
am fascinated with how readable and powerful ruby and Rails can work together to
make dynamic web applications.  I have used Rails to make my website and others.
One example is Hokie Links, a website where students can create notes and
reviews about classes at my current university, Virginia Tech.  The site is
hosted on Heroku, a new technology I picked while working with rails, as well as
Rspec and HAML.  Working on Rails has been the impetus behind staying with
the newest technologies as the software field is constantly changing.  While I
learn Rails, I enjoy iOS programming as well.  Swift is another new technology that
will be the face of iOS applications for years.

Lastly, let my state next that I truly love what I do.  In my spare time
I make YouTube videos of programming tips that I learn.  These videos
help me stay focused on what I am learning in class and help me review
later on.  Doing this has allowed to interact with other aspiring
programmers around the world and help them learn to code.  What draws me
to programming is that sort of interaction.  When you are on your
computer you can be a superhero.  You can move things around the world,
make people laugh, and change society all at your fingertips.

I am very interested in working for \companyName and would like the
opportunity to discuss a position with you.  My resume is attached
below.  I will contact you in a week to ten days to answer any questions
you may have. Thank you for your consideration.   I look forward to
speaking you about this opportunity.
