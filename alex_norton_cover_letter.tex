I am extremely interested in the Ruby on Rails Developer position.



I love teaching, I started a Youtube channel in 2011, Apple Juice Teaching, that has over 1,000,000 views and 5,000 loyal subscribers.  I loved teaching everyone how to code and how to set up their development environment.  I was a teaching assistant for two years at Virginia Tech and had hands-on experience working with students and planning lessons with the teachers.  Nothing brings me more pleasure than helping students learn.

I love C programming.  My time at Virginia Tech made me very fluent in C and Linux.  I made a shell implementation, wrote our own malloc implemention, and a web server.  Learning how to debug, read assembly, really taught me what object oriented programming languages are built on and taught me a core understanding of computer science.  I also took a multi-threading class that extensively covered p threads.  I also made a Youtube channel which taught C programming to any public user.

I have experience as an entrepreneur running my own website.  I learned how to use test driven development with Ruby on Rails with the database Postgres.  I learned how to use components of AWS, such as S3 and SES.  Writing all the software on my end taught me how to manage code and the importance of testing.  The importance of team work can not be understated at any company, a rising tide lifts all boats in the pier.


Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to meeting you to discuss how
I can support the mission of \companyName.
