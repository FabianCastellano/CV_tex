\indent Hello my name is Alex Norton.   I am seeking an entry-level software developer
position with \companyName.   I graduate this May with a bachelor’s degree in
Computer Science and hands on experience with Ruby on Rails to create and
implement web applications.  Currently, I am finishing my last semester abroad
in Oxford, England. 

As an undergraduate teaching assistant for the past year and an Amazon SDE
intern this summer.  I have learned how to collaborate with a team and work
outside my knowledge set.

At my internship at Amazon, my responsibilities included version control,
semantic highlighting and executing runtime environments.  All of the above
helped me understand the collaboration process between peers that must be
done in order to carry out a finely polished product.  My biggest discovery
was that to be successful in any field hinges on your ability to work
diligently with your coworkers to constantly over achieve.

What attracted me to \companyName is the power of sharing experiences.  When
you use \companyName you are doing more than sending them a picture, you are
entering their world.  You can show everyone a different culture, place, and
maybe emotions they have never seen before.  I have used  \companyName since it
first came out and it has not only brought me entertainment, but happiness.

What made me apply to this position of Software Developer is my love for
programming.  I have loved learning new technologies such as Hadoop for my
senior design project.  In that course we created a java program that would spin
up a Hadoop cluster for users to run batch jobs using their unshared resources.
I also aspire to be a self improver, by working on my design
skills in Adobe Illustrator, and new languages such as Swift.  Swift is another 
new technology that will be the face of iOS applications for years.

Lastly, let my state next that I truly love what I do.  In my spare time
I make YouTube videos of programming tips that I learn.  These videos
help me stay focused on what I am learning in class and help me review
later on.  Doing this has allowed to interact with other aspiring
programmers around the world and help them learn to code.  What draws me
to programming is that sort of interaction.  When you are on your
computer you can be a superhero.  You can move things around the world,
make people laugh, and change society all at your fingertips.

I am very interested in working for \companyName and would like the
opportunity to discuss a position with you.  My resume is attached
below.  I will contact you in a week to ten days to answer any questions
you may have. Thank you for your consideration.   I look forward to
speaking you about this opportunity.
